# Statistical Analysis Program

This repository contains a program for processing and statistical analysis of a large set of integers from a .txt file.

## Program Requirements

The program performs the following tasks from the file:
1. Finds the maximum number in the file.
2. Finds the minimum number in the file.
3. Computes the median.
4. Computes the arithmetic mean.
5. * Finds the longest increasing sequence of numbers (optional).
6. * Finds the longest decreasing sequence of numbers (optional).

The program should execute all these tasks in no more than 40 seconds.

## Additional Information

* **Median:** If the set of numbers has an even number of elements, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values.
* **Number Sequence:** This refers to the order of numbers in the file, occurring one after another.

## Using the Program

To use the program, upload a .txt file with the data and run the program to obtain the results.
